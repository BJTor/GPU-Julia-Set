This application allows you to explore the Julia Set of the Mandelbrot Set in MATLAB with the help of a capable NVIDIA GPU.  It is primarily intended as a demonstration of element-wise calculations using MATLAB and a GPU, however it also has some fun features:

* Use the normal MATLAB zoom and pan to browse the Julia Set
* Drag or click to select the location in the Mandelbrot Set for which the Julia Set is rendered
* Sit back and watch the app move around the Mandelbrot Set on a pre-stored path (zoom and pan still work)

## Requirements
This demo app requires:

* MATLAB R2016b or better (v9.1 or higher)
* Parallel Computing Toolbox
* An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA Compute Capability 3.0 or higher

## Running
From MATLAB, type "juliaSetExplorer" to launch the application.

## Help
From MATLAB, type "help juliaSetExplorer" to view the help for the application.
